      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering (AI) student at IIIT Manipur with interests in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Full-Stack Web Development. I have hands-on experience with Python, C++, JavaScript, and tools such as Scikit-learn, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL.

I have developed projects including a Housing Price Prediction system and a Resume Builder Web Application, strengthening my skills in data analysis, model evaluation, backend development, and user-focused application design. I also bring leadership and teamwork experience as a former school and house captain and am motivated by continuous learning and problem-solving.
